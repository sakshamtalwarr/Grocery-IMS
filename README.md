## 🚀 Project Overview

The Grocery Inventory Management System is a dynamic web application designed to streamline the inventory and employee management processes for a grocery store. It provides a robust Java Servlet backend to handle complex data operations, coupled with a modern, responsive user interface for seamless interaction.

The system features two distinct user roles, each with a dedicated portal:

- **Admin Portal**: A comprehensive dashboard for administrators to oversee all aspects of the business, including full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for products, employees, and product categories.
- **Employee Portal**: A focused dashboard for employees to manage daily tasks, including a point-of-sale (POS) system for generating customer bills, viewing product stock, and managing supplier orders.
